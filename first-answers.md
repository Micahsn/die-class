Answer to question 1:
    ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Micahsn/die-class.git'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
    hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Answer to question 2:
    ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Micahsn/die-class.git'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
    hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
    hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
